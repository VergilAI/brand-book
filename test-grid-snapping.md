# Grid Snapping Test Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Grid Snap UI Control
**Problem**: The grid snapping feature was enabled by default in the code (`gridSnap: true` in the snapping settings), but there was no checkbox in the UI to toggle it on/off.

**Solution**: Added a "Grid" checkbox to the snapping settings in both the drawing tool and map editor tool palettes.

### 2. Redundant Snap to Grid Setting
**Problem**: There were two separate snapping systems:
- Old system: `drawing.snapToGrid` (only shown when pen tool is selected)
- New system: `snapping.settings.gridSnap` (comprehensive snapping system)

**Solution**: Removed the old "Snap to Grid" checkbox that appeared only for the pen tool to avoid confusion.

## How Grid Snapping Works

1. **Grid Size**: Set in the Grid section (default: 10px)
2. **Snap Distance**: Set in the Snapping section (default: 15px)
3. **Grid Snap Logic**: When enabled, points within the snap distance of a grid intersection will snap to that grid point

## Testing Grid Snapping

To verify grid snapping is working:

1. **Enable Grid Display**: Click the Grid button to show the grid
2. **Enable Snapping**: Click the Snapping button (magnet icon)
3. **Enable Grid Snap**: Check the "Grid" checkbox in the snapping options
4. **Select Pen Tool**: Choose the pen tool to draw
5. **Draw Near Grid**: Click near grid intersections - the points should snap to the grid

## Code Flow

1. Drawing click â†’ `DrawingCanvas.handlePointerDown()`
2. Gets raw point from `position.svg`
3. Calls `getSnappedDrawingPoint()` which:
   - Calls `getSnappedPoint()` 
   - Which calls `getSnapCandidates()`
   - Which includes `findNearestGridPoint()` if `gridSnap` is enabled
4. Returns snapped point if within snap distance

The grid snapping is working in the code - it was just missing the UI control to toggle it.
