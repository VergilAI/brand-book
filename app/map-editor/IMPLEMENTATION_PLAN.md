## Technical Decisions

### State Management
**Zustand** over Redux for simplicity:
```typescript
const useMapStore = create<MapEditorState>((set, get) => ({
  map: createEmptyMap(),
  selection: new Set(),
  
  addTerritory: (territory) => set(state => ({
    map: {
      ...state.map,
      territories: {
        ...state.map.territories,
        [territory.id]: territory
      }
    }
  }))
}))
```

### Validation Strategy
- Run in Web Worker to prevent blocking
- Debounce 200ms after changes
- Visual feedback inline
- Errors prevent export

### Performance Targets
- 60fps with 100 territories
- <100ms validation time
- <50ms for undo/redo
- <1s export with optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Geometry algorithms (border detection, intersection)
- Validation rules
- State management actions
- Export/import formats

### Integration Tests  
- Drawing â†’ Border creation â†’ Validation flow
- Import â†’ Edit â†’ Export roundtrip
- Undo/redo consistency

### E2E Tests
- Draw complete map
- Fix validation errors
- Export and verify format

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Performance with many territories
**Mitigation:** 
- Virtual viewport rendering
- Spatial indexing for hit detection
- Progressive validation

### Risk: Browser compatibility
**Mitigation:**
- Target modern browsers only
- Polyfill pointer events
- Fallback for SVG filters

### Risk: Complex geometry edge cases
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive test suite
- Conservative algorithms
- Manual override tools

## Definition of Done

### MVP Requirements
- [x] Draw territories visually (completed with advanced features)
- [ ] Automatic border detection
- [x] Edit territory properties (completed)
- [ ] Real-time validation
- [ ] Export valid game format
- [ ] Import existing maps
- [ ] Undo/redo support
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts (completed)

### Quality Metrics

- 60fps performance with 100+ territories
- <100ms response time for all operations
- Zero runtime errors in production

- **Import existing maps** for editing
- **Format validation** on import
- **Path optimization** before export

### **Priority 4: Advanced Tools (Days 13-15)**
