# LMS Library Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the core library code for the Learning Management System (LMS) module, including game mechanics, data structures, and specialized algorithms.

## Key Modules

### Territory Conquest Game System

**Location**: `/lib/lms/`

The Territory Conquest system implements a sophisticated dual-layer architecture for strategy gaming:

#### Core Files
- `territory-conquest-data.ts` - Graph-based game logic and territory definitions
- `voronoi-tessellation.ts` - Voronoi diagram generation for perfect territory tessellation
- `territory-validation.ts` - Validation system ensuring graph-visual consistency
- `TERRITORY_CONQUEST_ARCHITECTURE.md` - **Complete technical documentation**

#### Architecture Highlights
- **Dual-Layer Design**: Separates game logic from visual representation
- **Perfect Tessellation**: Uses constrained Voronoi diagrams for puzzle-piece territory fit
- **Dynamic Sea Routes**: Algorithmically generated connections between territory coastlines
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive consistency checking between graph and visual layers

**ðŸ“– For complete technical details, implementation guides, and usage patterns, see:**
`TERRITORY_CONQUEST_ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Game Types and Mechanics

#### Flashcard System
- `flashcard-types.ts` - Type definitions for flashcard-based learning games
- Supports flip animations, hint systems, and progress tracking

#### General Game Framework
- `game-types.ts` - Common game mechanics and state management types
- Shared interfaces for scoring, timing, and completion tracking

## Architecture Patterns

### Type-First Development
All library modules follow TypeScript-first development with comprehensive type definitions:

```typescript
interface GameState<T> {
  status: 'idle' | 'playing' | 'paused' | 'completed'
  data: T
  metadata: GameMetadata
}
```

### Modular Design
Each game system is self-contained with clear interfaces:
- Game logic separated from UI components
- Validation systems for data integrity
- Helper functions for common operations

### Performance Considerations
- Memoized calculations for expensive operations
- Efficient data structures (Maps for O(1) lookups)
- Lazy loading for large datasets

## Usage Patterns

### Territory Conquest Implementation
```typescript
import { 
  createTerritoryGraph, 
  generateVoronoiTessellation,
  validateGraphVoronoiConsistency 
} from '@/lib/lms/territory-conquest-data'

const graph = createTerritoryGraph()
const tessellation = generateVoronoiTessellation(seeds, boundaries, bounds)
const validation = validateGraphVoronoiConsistency(graph, tessellation.territories)
```

### Game State Management
```typescript
import type { GameState, GameMetadata } from '@/lib/lms/game-types'

const gameState: GameState<TerritoryGameData> = {
  status: 'playing',
  data: { territories: new Map(), currentPlayer: 'player1' },
  metadata: { startTime: Date.now(), version: '1.0' }
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Game Systems
1. Create type definitions in dedicated file (e.g., `new-game-types.ts`)
2. Implement core logic with comprehensive validation
3. Add comprehensive documentation following the Territory Conquest pattern
4. Include unit tests for all public interfaces

### Validation Requirements
All game systems should include:
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
- Runtime validation for critical game state
- Consistency checking between related data structures
- Performance benchmarks for complex algorithms

### Documentation Standards
- Comprehensive README/architecture docs for complex systems
- Inline JSDoc for all public functions
- Usage examples and common patterns
- Performance characteristics and limitations

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and development experience
- **d3-delaunay**: Mathematical tessellation (Territory Conquest only)

### Development Dependencies
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **@types/node**: Node.js type definitions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Pure function testing for mathematical algorithms
- Type validation for complex data structures
- Performance benchmarks for expensive operations

### Integration Tests
- Cross-module compatibility testing
- Validation system correctness
- End-to-end game flow testing

## Performance Considerations

### Territory Conquest System
- **Voronoi Generation**: O(n log n) complexity, ~100ms for 42 territories
- **Validation Checks**: O(nÂ²) neighbor comparison with optimizations
- **Memory Usage**: ~15KB for complete tessellated map data

### General Guidelines
- Use Map/Set for O(1) lookups over arrays
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations
- Consider Web Workers for CPU-intensive operations
- Profile regularly with realistic datasets

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Additional Game Types**: Quiz systems, matching games, word puzzles
2. **Enhanced Validation**: Real-time consistency checking during gameplay
3. **Performance Optimizations**: WebGL rendering, spatial indexing
4. **Multiplayer Support**: Shared game state management

### Architecture Evolution
- Pluggable game engine system
- Standardized save/load mechanisms
- Cross-platform compatibility layer
- Analytics and telemetry integration
