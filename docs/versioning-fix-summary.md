# Versioning System Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The token build process was reading from the wrong directory, preventing the versioning system from working properly.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Fixed build-tokens.ts**
- Changed source directory from `/design-tokens/source/` to `/design-tokens/active/source/`
- Updated version to match active version (2.1.0-dev)

### 2. **Updated Other Scripts**
- Fixed `migration-review.ts` to read from versioned source
- Fixed `token-manager/parser.ts` to use active directory

### 3. **Cleaned Up Legacy Directory**
- Moved `/design-tokens/source/` to `/design-tokens/source.legacy-backup/`
- Added backup directory to .gitignore

## How It Works Now

1. **Active Development**: All token development happens in `/design-tokens/active/source/`
2. **Version Tracking**: Current version is 2.1.0-dev
3. **Token Building**: `npm run build:tokens` now correctly reads from the versioned source
4. **Version Creation**: When ready to release, use `npm run version:create` to archive

## Verification Steps

1. Add a new token to `/design-tokens/active/source/colors.yaml`
2. Run `npm run build:tokens`
3. Check that the token appears in `/generated/tokens.ts` and other outputs
4. The generated files show version "2.1.0-dev"

## Version Management Commands

- `npm run version:list` - See all versions
- `npm run version:info` - Current version details
- `npm run version:create` - Create a new version release
- `npm run version:diff v2.0.0` - Compare with previous versions

The versioning system is now fully operational and correctly integrated with the token build process!
